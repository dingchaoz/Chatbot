Many companies are hoping to build chatbots indistinguishable from human ones, 
and many are claiming to be using NLP and deep learning to make this possible, but
with all the hypes around sometimes it is difficult to tell fact from fiction.

A taxonomy of models:
Retrieval based vs Generative models
Retrieval bases use a repository of predefined responses and some kind of heuristic to
pick an appropriate response based on input and context. The heuristic could be as a rule-
based expression match or as complex as an ensemble of machine learning classifier,
these systems don't generate any new text, they just pick a response from a fixed set.
Generative models generate new responses from scratch and typically based on deep learning
technique.

Both approaches have pros and cons, retrieval based model don't make grammatical errors
but unable to handle unseen cases; generative models is the state of art, but hard to train,
typically requires huge amounts of training data, and quiet likely to make grammatical 
mistakes, which can be very costly and may drive away users. That's why most systems dealing
serious business cases now are using retrieval bases models .

First Quora public dataset release: question pairs
400,000 lines of potential question duplicate pairs,
each line contains questions in full text, and a binary value
indicating whether the line truly is duplicate or not.
